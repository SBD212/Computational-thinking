            <h1>Reflection and Future Learning</h1>
            <p> Computational thinking has been a unique module in that it has afforded me the opportunity to 
                practically apply the concepts that I’ve learnt, not just in the module itself, but also to other modules in the course.
                <br> <br>From a purely technical perspective, I’ve learnt key concepts of web development using HTML and CSS 
                and how to host my own website on a server; all of which has been totally new to me.</p>

                    <h2> What have I Learnt? </h2>
                    <p> In our very first class, we were taught about the four fundamental processes of computational thinking and 
                        how they can be employed in approaching virtually any problem. For me, this has served a great blueprint 
                        to tackle all and any programming exercise. This includes not only the module computational thinking itself, 
                        but also the <em>‘Fundamentals of Programming’</em> and <em>'IT Management'</em>  modules. Incidentally, it cannot be understated how much it has 
                        helped me on this very coursework too.</p>

                    <h2> How will it benefit me? </h2>
                    <p> Since the core concepts of computational thinking are universal, I can always find ways to implement them in other subjects, 
                        content area or even courses:</p>
                        <ul class = "content2_list">
                            <li><p>	Extrapolating unnecessary information and looking for key information can help overcome 
                                    struggles when learning something new. </p></li>
                            <li><p>	I think decomposition part of computational thinking has a place in literally every challenge we face in life from 
                                    the most routine of daily activities such as driving, walking, making food, doing laundry etc. 
                                    to breaking down seemingly challenging tasks such as this coursework. </p></li>   
                            <li><p>	Naturally algorithm design has been my go-to practice before trying to write code for any given task in the 
                                    <em>'Fundamental of Programming'</em> and <em> 'Computational Thinking' </em>modules. Even the most challenging 
                                    problems become quite simple once I break them down to a step-by-step process by designing an algorithm. </p></li>
                            <li><p>	Pattern recognition is a tricky one because its one of those skills we pick up at an early age instinctively 
                                    without being it really taught to us. For this course, it will make problem solving efficient, 
                                    less error prone and in general less of a hassle. One very specific case I can think of where pattern recognition 
                                    is crucial in programming problems which require recursion, where it can make the code simply be more efficient.</p></li>
                            <li><p>	All four cornerstones of computational thinking can of course be utilized in software development cycle e.g., 
                                    pattern recognition can prevent help in group assignments to avoid similar pitfalls. 
                                    </p></li>

                    <h2> Final Thoughts </h2>
                    <p> For me, computational thinking has laid the groundwork for future programming endeavors particularly.
                        Since this course entails a lot of coding, this module has given me the confidence and right tools to solve challenging
                        problems. Additionally, it has piqued my curiosity for web development, something which I previously considered to be 
                        cumbersome. Now, I find styling webpages with CSS quite fun and rewarding. </p>
                        <p> Looking beyond this course, I think the ideas and practices in this module wil aid me tremendously no matter 
                        where I end up. Of course the technical knowledge gained cannot be understated, but the way it has changed my approach 
                        from thinking about problems to thinking about problem solving is invaluable. </p>
