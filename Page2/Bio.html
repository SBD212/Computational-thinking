                <h1>Turing Machine (1936)</h1>
                <p> Arguably, Alan Turing’s most important contribution to the field of computer science was his concept of the 'Turing
                Machine'. In 1936 during his PhD at Princeton, he published a paper titled <em> “On Computable Numbers, with an application
                to the Entscheidungsproblem,”</em>. In it, Turing presented the idea of a hypothetical machine which could perform a 
                mathematical computation if it was fed a long paper tape of instructions which it could read one at a time.<br> 
                <br> Turing demonstrated that you could construct a universal machine. This was ground-breaking stuff since on closer inspection,
                 this <em>‘universal machine’</em> is essentially the modern computer.</p>

                <h1>The Enigma (1939)</h1>
                <p>During WWII, Turing returned to Britain to work in the <em> British Government Code and Cipher School</em> and cracked the 
                <em>‘unbreakable’</em> german enigma secret ciphers used by the german navy. After 1939, with help from other mathematicians 
                    Turing developed a new machine called the <em>Bombe</em> capable of deciphering the enigma messages at a large scale.</p>

                <h1>Turing Test (1950)</h1>
                <p> Turing can most famously be attributed with the <em> 'Turing Test'</em> : a simple yet brilliant experiment
                    to distinguish man from machine.<br> 
                    <br>In the test, there are three terminals: two are operated by humans and one by a computer. 
                    One of the two persons (assume A) has the job of asking questions from the other person(assume B), and the 
                    computer on a specific subject. This process is repeated a few times. At the end, A is asked to distinguish 
                    B from the computer. If A predicts incorrectly based on the answers, then the computer  is said to possess 
                    <em> Artificial Intelligence</em>. Of course, the Turing Test has its fair share of limitations and critics, yet despite 
                    the critics the Turing test remains at the heart of Artifical Intelligence.

                <p>In 1952, Turing was convicted of gross indecency. Two years later on 8 June 1954, he was found dead in his apartment 
                    as a result of cyanide poisoning, later declared to be suicide.<br><br> 
                    In 2013 he was formally pardoned from ‘gross indecency’ by Queen Elizabeth II. On 15 July 2019, he was announced as the new face of the 50 note, 
                    which went into circulation on 23 June 2021, his date of birth.</p>
