            <p class = "intro_para"> <em>'Computational thinking'</em> doesn't necessarily mean to think like a computer. The most rudimentary way
                 to define it is problem solving. In today's day and age, CT is a key skill required to solve increasingly complex problems. 
                 And the unique part about it is that its fundamentals can be applied to virtually anything. Need to know how to 
                 fix a broken car? Need to know how to cook steak? Need to program a computer? Need to design a retail software? 
                 Computational thinking has got you covered.

            <p>
                Computational thinking consists of four fundamental techniques or processes. In order to fully understand these, we will 
                look at an example.<br> <br>
    
                Let’s say we are given a complex problem such as designing a blueprint for a sprawling 8 story mall. 
                The first step is to break this complex problem into a series of small problems so they can be looked at individually
                <strong>(decomposition)</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we look for any underlying patterns or similarities between these problems and similar ones which 
                have already been solved such as designs for malls in the vicinity. 
                This is known as <strong>pattern recognition</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third step is to find out which information is relevant in the given context and focus on only
                that by ignoring everything else. This may include factors such as weather, infrastructure, 
                population to name a few. This process is known as <strong>abstraction</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, we design a step-by-step process or algorithm to solve each of these smaller problems <strong>(algorithm design)</strong>.
                Figuratively speaking, all four are equally important and play like the pillars of a building - 
                without any one of them the whole thing will collapse.

            <p>
                For people like me who are aspiring for careers in the IT industry specifically, 
                I believe CT is a must have tool to have in your arsenal. With the increasingly sophistication of technology
                and more data than ever to filter, CT becomes indispensable since it provides reliable methods of solving problems. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And one of the key skills tech companies and organizations look for in people is how adept they are at solving
                problems. Even if someone is not working in a tech related field or a totally different field altogether, 
                the ability to approach a problem coherently and come up with a solution is skill that can make you a highly sought after 
                candidate. 
            </p>

            <p>
                CT has immense potential of course. For example with the help of CT models, the effects of climate change on the ecosystem can
                be predicted. Also how will the covid-19 pandemic affect healthcare? What will be result of repercussion of automation on the job market?
            </p>

                In a 2007 article, <em> “Computational Thinking is Pervasive,”</em> published in the Journal of Scientific and Practical Computing,
                Alan Bundy writes that CT is <em>“influencing research in nearly all disciplines, including sciences and humanities.” </em>(Bundy, A 2007, p.1).
                He also says that it was <em>changing how we think:</em> <br> <br>
                <nbsp></nbsp>Computational concepts provide a new language for describing hypotheses and theories. Computers provide an extension 
                to our cognitive faculties. If you want to understand the 21st century then you must first understand computation (Bundy, A 2007, p.1). 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Context matters...</h2>
            <p>
                Within the context of this course, with programming being its backbone, using CT methods becomes an inevitability. Before the actual coding can take place, we must utilize the processes of CT. 
                That’s because determining the flow and results of the program is way more challenging than writing the code. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This makes CT a fun and engaging experience because quite frankly coding does become dull (eventually).
